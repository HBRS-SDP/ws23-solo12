   - Implement a test to measure and confirm that the control loop operates at the specified frequency.

## 2. Integration Testing

### 2.1 Communication Abstraction

**Objective:** Confirm that the API's communication abstraction works seamlessly and agnostically with other robot software components.

**Test Cases:**
1. **Integration with Control Module:**
   - Integrate the API with a simulated or real control module.
   - Verify that control commands from the API affect the robot's behavior as expected.

2. **Integration with Perception Module:**
   - Test the API's integration with a perception module.
   - Ensure that perception data can influence the robot's control through the API.

### 2.2 Simulation and ROS Integration

**Objective:** Ensure smooth integration of the API with simulation (Gazebo) and the Robot Operating System (ROS).

**Test Cases:**
1. **Gazebo Integration:**
   - Integrate the API with Gazebo.
   - Validate that the API functions correctly within the simulated environment.

2. **ROS Node Integration:**
   - Implement ROS nodes that communicate with the API.
   - Confirm that the API works seamlessly within the ROS ecosystem.

### 2.3 Safety Features and Testing

**Objective:** Verify the implementation of safety features and conduct thorough testing for secure robot operation.

**Test Cases:**
1. **Limit Threshold Detection:**
   - Test the API's response to commands exceeding joint limits.
   - Confirm that the API triggers safety mechanisms appropriately.

2. **Emergency Stop Procedure:**
   - Simulate emergency situations and trigger an emergency stop.
   - Verify that the robot halts safely and enters a secure state.


## 3. Automation

### 3.1 Automated Testing

**Objective:** Implement automated tests to streamline the testing process.

**Test Cases:**
1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Develop unit tests for individual API functions.
   - Automate the execution of unit tests.

2. **Integration Tests:**
   - Implement automated integration tests for various modules.
   - Ensure the tests cover communication, control, and safety aspects.


## 4. Review and Deployment

### 4.1 Project Review

**Objective:** Review the project progress and prepare for deployment.

**Test Cases:**
1. **Code Review:**
   - Conduct a thorough code review of the entire project.
   - Address any identified issues or areas for improvement.

2. **Feedback Collection:**
   - Gather feedback from internal stakeholders and potential users.
   - Document and prioritize feedback for future improvements.

### 4.2 Deployment

**Objective:** Prepare for the final release and deployment of the API.

**Test Cases:**
1. **Release Preparation:**
   - Create a release branch and conduct final testing.
   - Ensure all features and safety measures are in place.

2. **Version Tagging:**
   - Tag the final version in the Git repository.

3. **Release on GitHub:**
   - Publish the release on GitHub, including release notes.

## 5. Finalization and Post-Deployment

### 5.1 User Validation

**Objective:** Validate the API's functionality with end-users.

**Test Cases:**
1. **User Testing:**
